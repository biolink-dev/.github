# Coding Guidelines

Welcome to the coding guidelines for our open-source project! These guidelines are designed to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of our codebase. All contributors are expected to follow these guidelines when making changes to the project.

## General Guidelines

- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, and add comments when necessary to explain complex logic.

- **Consistency**: Follow a consistent coding style and adhere to the conventions established in this document.

- **Modularity**: Keep code modular and aim for single responsibility functions and classes.

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and failures.

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes should go through code review before merging.

- **Open Communication**: If you have questions or are unsure about a coding decision, don't hesitate to ask for clarification from other contributors.

## Code Style

- **Indentation**: Use spaces for indentation (typically 4 spaces).

- **Naming Conventions**: Follow naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes. (e.g., `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `snake_case` for functions).

- **Maximum Line Length**: Limit lines to 80-100 characters.

- **Imports**: Organize import statements alphabetically and separate them into sections (e.g., standard library imports, third-party imports, internal imports).

- **Whitespace**: Use whitespace consistently. Add a single space after commas, operators, and colons in dictionaries.

- **Comments**: Include comments for non-obvious code sections and explanations of complex algorithms. Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.

## Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings for classes, functions, and methods. Use clear and concise descriptions of their purpose, parameters, and return values.

- **README**: Maintain an up-to-date README.md file with project documentation, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Testing

- **Test Coverage**: Write tests to cover critical functionality. Aim for high test coverage to ensure code reliability.

- **Test Names**: Use descriptive test names that convey the purpose and expected behavior of the test.

- **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on external state or resources.

## Version Control

- **Branching**: Follow a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, bugfix branches) and create pull requests for code changes.

- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

- **Pull Requests**: Describe the purpose and scope of the pull request in the description. Reference related issues if applicable.

These coding guidelines are meant to foster collaboration and maintain code quality throughout our project's development. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that our codebase remains consistent and accessible to all contributors. Thank you for being part of our open-source community!
